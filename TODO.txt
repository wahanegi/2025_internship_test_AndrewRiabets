Unfinished Work
I have one entirely incomplete issue (#18) and one partially completed issue (#19). 
The reason for not completing these tasks is the lack of time during the final weekend before the project deadline, 
as well as concerns about potentially breaking existing functionality in a time-sensitive environment.

TODO List
To complete issues #18 and #19, the following changes are required:

1. Update routes.rb:
	- Change root "welcome#index" to root "homepage#index".
	- Add the following routes(get "home", to: "homepage#index"; get "welcome", to: "welcome#index")
2. Modify TweetsController:
	- Remove the default authorization check for rendering the main content.
	- Add authorization checks for the create and destroy methods. If the user is not authorized, return a 401 Unauthorized error.
3. No changes are needed for LikesController, as it already includes authorization checks for creating and deleting likes.
4. Frontend Updates:
	- Add error handling for API calls in components. Specifically, handle 401 Unauthorized errors by redirecting the user with window.location.href = '/';

Below is a list of tasks I intended and planned to implement but could not complete due to time constraints

Additional Tasks
1. Add a 404 Component for Unknown Routes:
   Currently, the application has a root route (/), /home, and Devise routes. If a user navigates to an unknown route, they encounter a blank page. 
	 A 404 component should be implemented to handle such cases.
2. Error Handling:
	Review all components to ensure that every user interaction (both in the API and on the client) has friendly error handling. 
	Add error handling where missing.
3. Error Notifications for Devise Forms:
	Currently, there are no error messages displayed in Devise forms for issues like invalid login credentials or lost internet connection. 
	Add user-friendly notifications to handle such scenarios.
4. Write Tests for Models:
	Create test cases for the Tweet and Like models to ensure the correctness of their behaviors.
5. Date Validation in Tweet.jsx:
	- The date formatting assumes that created_at will always be valid. If the value is null or in an incorrect format, the application may break. 
	Add a check for created_at before attempting to format it.
6. Confirmation Modal on Logout:
	- Currently, there is no confirmation dialog when logging out, which might be inconvenient for users. 
	Add a modal window to confirm logout actions.
